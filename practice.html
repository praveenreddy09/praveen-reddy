In April 2011, during a football game a student was beaten by opposition team members and died a few hours later in hospital. The beaten student was from Mizoram and the three accused were Sudanese and Tanzanian.[21] The racial aspect of the crime led to near-rioting on the campus by students, destroying a number of kiosks and cars. Tension continued with the university closed for three days, and with police being pelted with stones by angry students.[22] LPU Pro-Chancellor Rashmi Mittal described the attack as, "students didnâ€™t take the spirit of the game in a positive manner".[23] The university's management have also been criticized for ignoring earlier and later racial attacks.[24]
